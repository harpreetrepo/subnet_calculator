This is an Android app that i build in visual studio with C#. When you download the APK file directly into your android phone you have to give permission to allow download and installation of the app from Unknown sources. 

Once install you have the full access to this app, you can use this app for both your study, day 1 and day 2 operations.

Please do share your feedback and let me know if you need its tutorial.
